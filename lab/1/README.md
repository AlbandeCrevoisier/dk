# Lab 1: introduction to scikit-learn #

In this lab, I had to use various classifiers on the sk-learn toy dataset iris,
as well as implement a majority class classifier and an optional other
classifier. I implemented the next simplest one:
* If the observation was in the training set, return its observed value.
* Otherwise, return the majority class.
