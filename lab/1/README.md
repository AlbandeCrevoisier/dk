# Recommendation system #

This lab is an implementation of a recommandation system in java using Hadoop MapReduce.

The test data is in the in/ directory and the result is output in out/.

The data consists in text files in which a line represents a cart, i.e. a set of items bought together;
and the output lists how many times each item was bought with a given item.

Make:
* `make` : compile and compress
* `make execute` : run code on example in/
* `make clean` : clean everything
